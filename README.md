spf13-vim-local
===============

My local customization of spf13-vim for web-development.

spf13-vim (https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim) is a packaged vim configuration
distribution.  It supports customizing your local configuration via
.vimrc.local and .vimrc.bundles.local files in your home directory. 

This repo contains my local customizations of the distribution. Start by
installing spf13-vim using the instructions from the repo above. Then, install
these local customizations as follows:

    git clone https://github.com/Raigen/spf13-vim-local ~/.spf13-vim-local
    ~/.spf13-vim-local/create-symlinks.sh

Other dependencies for my enviroment:
* nodejs and npm
* git
* npm install jslint
